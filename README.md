# Securly-Bypass-File
A simple file extension called .securlybypass that can be opened in any GitHub Codespace. (meant for securly bypasses, DUH)

# How to use for dummies
create a codespace in this repo
then, in the terminal run 

chmod+x run.sh

Then, run ./run.sh
This will run the .securlybypass file. 

# Later Updates
i might make this so that it works on the computer, that way you wont need to make a codespace everytime.

# Things To note

the launcher i made is very ugly, i didnt really have to much time to work on it, updates would be appreciated!!!
