# Securly-Bypass-File
A simple file extension called .securlybypass that can be opened in any GitHub Codespace. (meant for securly bypasses, DUH)

# How to use for dummies
create a codespace in this repo
then, in the terminal run 

chmod+x run.sh

Then, run ./run.sh
This will run the .securlybypass file. 

# Later Updates
1. i might make this so that it works on the computer, that way you wont need to make a codespace everytime.
2. add a proxy using pyhton to the file to attempt to make it kind of undetectable

# Things To note

the launcher i made is very ugly, i didnt really have to much time to work on it, updates would be appreciated!!!



also u can use the GO proxy to bypass securly, any link works, have fun!!!!!!!

also please leave a star ; u see, its good for ego LOL
